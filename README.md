# Indian-General-Elections
This project focuses on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using any analytical tool for the 2019 Indian General Elections dataset. The dataset, available on Kaggle and created by Prakrut Chauhan, serves as the foundation for the analysis.
The dataset encompasses comprehensive details about candidates who participated in the elections across different constituencies. It encompasses both personal attributes like assets, education, and criminal records, and electoral attributes like the constituency they contested from their affiliated political party, the total count of received votes, and more.
Throughout the project, we leverage a variety of analytical tools to cleanse the data and create insightful visualizations. The objective is to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset to extract meaningful insights about the 2019 Indian General Elections.
